  - "Greetings weary traveler, you\u2019re a long way from home."
  - Who am I? Oh, just a lone Pilgrim searching for a better life. Nothing special
    about me.
  - "But you\u2026I sense great potential in you. Oh, yes. Such great potential.
    \r"
  - "Oh, but I am getting ahead of myself. If you wish to unlock your potential,
    kill the King of Crimson and his Kangaroo court. \r"
  - "Only then will your destiny be revealed. \r"
  - "Help yourself to whatever you may find in my humble abode. It may prove paramount
    to your journey. \r \r"
  - "We\u2019ll meet again, but until then take care on your travels. But remember,
    never trust the words of those with false smiles.\r\r \r"
